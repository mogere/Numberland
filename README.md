- Receive input (E- first count of even numbers,O - first count of odd numbers)
- Pass these received values to a function that accepts 2 integers and passes 
each to the calculating function. (after deleting 1 from the odd number value since 0
is not considered an even number in this case)
- The formula for getting the number of pictures will be 2 raised to C minus 1. 
Write this out to a function which returns an integer which is the number of pictures that
will be taken by each respective odd or even number.  
- Pass each of the odd and even numbers in the range as a parameter into the function
and find the sum of the returned values.
